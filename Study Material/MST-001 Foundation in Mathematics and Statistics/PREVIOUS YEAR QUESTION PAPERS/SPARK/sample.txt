Spark Paired RDDs are nothing but RDDs containing a key-value pair. 
Basically, key-value pair (KVP) consists of a two linked data item in it. 
Here, the key is the identifier, whereas value is the data corresponding to the key value.
Moreover, Spark operations work on RDDs containing any type of objects. 
However key-value pair RDDs attains few special operations in it. Such as, distributed “shuffle” operations, grouping or aggregating the elements by a key.
In addition, on Spark Paired RDDs containing Tuple2 objects in Scala, these operations are automatically available. 
Basically, operations for the key-value pair are available in the Pair RDD functions class. However, that wraps around a Spark RDD of tuples.
